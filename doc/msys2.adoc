= MSYS2

https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2] is an easy way for Windows users to access to GNU development tools such as `make`, as well as many other open source tools. It's easy to install and configure:

. Download and install the latest build of MSYS2 from here: https://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/[MSYS2 distributions for Win64]. This will normally be the last *.exe* file in the list.

. Open an *MSYS2 MSYS* shell (the last step in the install process offers this as an option).

. Update the package database by entering the following command:

  pacman -Syu
+
The update will conclude by closing the shell.

. Open an *MSYS2 MSYS* shell again. Perform a system upgrade by entering the following command:

  pacman -Su

. Install `make` and `git` by entering the following command:

  pacman -S --needed make git

. **RECOMMENDED**: Add the `usr\bin` and `mingw64\bin` subdirectory of the MSYS2 install to your Windows path to allow use use of MSYS2 tools from the Windows Command Prompt.
