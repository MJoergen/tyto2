= MSYS2

https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2] is an easy way for Windows users to get GNU and other open source tools such as GHDL and NVC. It's easy to install and configure:

. Download and install the latest build of MSYS2 from here: https://repo.msys2.org/distrib/x86_64/[MSYS2 distributions for Win64]. This will normally be the last *.exe* file in the list.

. Open an *MSYS2 MSYS* shell (the last step in the install process offers this as an option).

. Update the system, and package database, by entering the following command:

  pacman -Syyu
+
The update will conclude by closing the shell.

. Open an *MSYS2 MSYS* shell again. Install basic development tools by entering the following command:

  pacman -S --needed base-devel git

. Create a Environment Variable named `MSYS2` set to the install location of MSYS2, and add the MSYS2 and MinGW binary directories to your Windows path in the following order:

  %MSYS2%/mingw64/bin
  %MSYS2%/mingw32/bin
  %MSYS2%/usr/bin
