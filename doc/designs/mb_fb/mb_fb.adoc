= mb_fb

This design combines a MicroBlaze CPU with a graphics frame buffer, and supports a variety of display resolutions from 640x480 to 1920x1080. The display colour depth is 24 bits (RGB).

Supported boards: *Digilent Nexys Video* and *QMTECH Wukong*.

The frame buffer is held in DDR3 SDRAM and the design uses a simple arbiter to share access to the DDR3 IP core's user interface between the CPU and the display controller, with priority going to the display.

A simple MicroBlaze demo application is included, based on link:https://github.com/tuupola/hagl[Mike Tuupola's *hagl* graphics library].

== Building and Programming

Build the Vivado or Quartus project by running `make` in the relevant `build` directory, and program your board from the command line by running `make prog`. Once the project is built, you may use the IDE.

== Design Description

The diagram below shows the main design blocks:

image::./mb_fb.svg[title="Overview of the mb_fb design.",align="center"]

The modules shown are described below:

top:: A board specific wrapper around the main design and the DDR3 controller IP core.

mig:: Board specific DDR3 controller IP core, produced by Xilinx Memory Interface Generator (MIG).

mb_fb:: Top level of main design.

microblaze:: A Xilinx Block Diagram - see the *MicroBlaze CPU Subsystem* section below for further details.

mig_bridge_axi:: Bridges from CPU's AXI bus master to the the MIG user interface.

crtc:: Video clocking and timing control. The name is a throwback to the Cathode Ray Tube Controllers used in 80s and 90s era home computers.

mig_bridge_crtc:: Drives MIG user interface to fetch pixels from memory as required by CRTC.

mig_hub:: A priority arbiter to share access to the DDR3 controller's user interface between multiple masters.

dvi_tx:: Contains TMDS encoders and serialisers to drive a DVI display monitor.

=== MicroBlaze CPU Subsystem

The MicroBlaze CPU is instantiated within a Xilinx Block Diagram file:

image::./microblaze.svg[title="MicroBlaze CPU subsystem.",align="center"]

The blocks are described below:

cpu:: MicroBlaze CPU, 32 bit, microcontroller preset, no caches.

ram:: 64kBytes for CPU instructions and data.

interconnect:: AXI interconnect to allow the CPU AXI master to connect to 3 AXI slaves.

gpio:: AXI GPIO IP core, configured for 2 channels: 8 outputs on the first channel, 8 inputs on the second.

uart:: "Lite" UART IP core, fixed at 115200N81, to provide console I/O (not used in this design).

rstctrl:: Reset controller IP core.

debug:: CPU debug controller IP core.

If you alter the block diagram in Vivado, you will need to export a TCL script to recreate by entering the following command in the TCL Console:

 write_bd_tcl -force -include_layout ../../../src/designs/mb_fb/microblaze.tcl
 
To update the documentation, export an SVG image by entering the following command in the TCL Console:

 write_bd_layout ‑force ‑format svg ../../../doc/designs/mb_fb/microblaze.svg

== MicroBlaze Software

The application initialises the frame buffer and hagl library, draws 100 random graphical objects (lines, triangles, rectangles or ellipses), overlays this with a simple grid, and prints a message.

== Simulation

A simulation testbench is provided as part of the Vivado project. This captures the video output to a BMP file. Note that simulation run times are substantial. Alternative testbenches are provided to simulate simplified versions of the design that exclude the MIG; these run much faster.
