== Design Description

Please refer to the description of the <<../mb_cb/mb_cb.adoc#,mb_cb>> design. This design adds the following blocks, wired to CPU GPIOs:

* *PS2*: A `ps2_host` IP core - this presents a pair of unidirectional parallel interfaces and moves data between these and a bidirectional PS/2 serial port.
* *HID*: A `ps2_to_usbhid` IP core - this converts variable length PS/2 code sequences into single byte USB HID key codes.

== MicroBlaze Software

A simple keyboard driver is added to the main application, and debug messages are printed when keys are pressed or released.
