= The Tyto Project (Version 2)

The Tyto Project is a collection of open source FPGA designs and IP for retro computing and embedded systems, with an emphasis on VHDL and support for both AMD/Xilinx and Intel/Altera targets.

This repository is incomplete. Work to port all the designs and IP from the https://github.com/amb5l/tyto_project[previous version] is ongoing.

A simpler directory structure is used:

* `src` contains source code for designs as well as common IP.

* `build` contains makefiles for designs on supported targets. The subdirectory name consists of the design name followed by the target name. For simulation only cases, the target name indicates the simulator: `xsim` for Xilinx Vivado, `ghdl` for http://ghdl.free.fr/[GHDL] and `sim` for Questa, ModelSim etc.

* `doc` contains documentation.

* `submodules` contains git submodules.

NOTE: ALL designs have submodule dependencies. Please remember to initialise submodules when cloning this repo!

|<<./doc/designs/ddr3_test/ddr3_test.adoc#,ddr3_test >> 
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong
|A simple DDR3 SDRAM tester based on https://github.com/jorisvr/vhdl_prng[Joris van Rantwijk's Pseudo Random Number Generator]. Hacks the generated HDL to generate the 200MHz IODELAYCTRL reference clock in the DDR3 IP core MMCM.

|<<./doc/designs/mb_fb/mb_fb.adoc#,mb_fb>>
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong
|A MicroBlaze CPU with a 24 bpp high resolution graphics frame buffer held in DDR3 SDRAM, with simple demo application based on link:https://github.com/tuupola/hagl[Mike Tuupola's hagl graphics library]. 

|<<doc/designs/np6532_poc/np6532_poc.adoc#,np6532_poc>>
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong, Altera Cyclone V Dev Kit, Terasic DE10-Nano
|A proof-of-concept demonstration of the <<doc/common/retro/np65/np65.adoc#,np65>> 6502 compatible CPU core clocked at 32MHz. Runs https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests[Klaus Dormann's 6502 functional test] in a loop.

|<<doc/designs/np6532_functest/np6532_functest.adoc#,np6532_functest>>
|(simulation only)
|Simulates an <<doc/common/retro/np65/np65.adoc#,np65>> CPU core unning https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests[Klaus Dormann's 6502 functional test].

|<<doc/designs/tb_saa5050/tb_saa5050.adoc#,tb_saa5050>>
|(simulation only)
|Simulates an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullard_SAA5050[SAA5050] teletext character generator. 

|<<doc/designs/T65_functest/T65_functest.adoc#,T65_functest>>
|(simulation only)
|Simulates a T65 CPU core running https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests[Klaus Dormann's 6502 functional test].

== Build and Simulation Tools

Part of the motivation for this new repo was a move to a makefile driven build process - so https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU make] is required, along with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git[git] and assorted utilities that are usually present on Linux systems. <<doc/msys2.adoc#,MSYS2>> is a quick and easy way to get these tools (as well as http://ghdl.free.fr/[GHDL]) running on Windows. Some builds also require https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3].

The build process produces projects that can be opened and worked on in the relevant IDE:

* For Xilinx FPGAs, *Vivado 2021.2* is required. Designs including a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze[Microblaze soft CPU] also require *Vitis 2021.2*. These tools may be obtained from https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html[here].

* For Intel FPGAs, *Quartus Prime Lite 21.1* is required. This may be obtained from https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html[here].
