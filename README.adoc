= The Tyto Project (Version 2)

The Tyto Project is a collection of open source FPGA designs and IP for retro computing and embedded systems, with an emphasis on VHDL and support for both AMD/Xilinx and Intel/Altera targets.

This repository is incomplete. Work to port all the designs and IP from the https://github.com/amb5l/tyto_project[previous version] is ongoing.

A simpler directory structure is used:

* `src` contains source code for designs and common IP.

* `build` contains makefiles for FPGA builds.

* `test` contains makefiles for simulation testbenches.

* `doc` contains documentation.

* `submodules` contains git submodules.

To build an FPGA design, navigate to the board specific subdirectory under `build/` and run the `make` command.

|=== 

Simulations will normally run on any supported simulator (GHDL, NVC, ModelSim/Questa, Vivado). To run a simulation, navigate to its subdirectory under `build/` and run the `make` command.

== Dependancies

NOTE: **ALL** designs have submodule dependencies. Please remember to initialise submodules when cloning this repository!

. https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU make], https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/[GNU core utilities] and https://git-scm.com/[git] are required. These are normally present on Linux systems. Windows users should use **MSYS2** to get these tools running - see <<doc/msys2.adoc#,these notes>> for further details.

. Building an FPGA design requires vendor tools, and produces projects that can be opened and worked on in the vendor's IDE:

* For AMD/Xilinx FPGAs, *Vivado* is required - the free *Standard Edition* is sufficient. Version since *2020* are supported. *Note:* designs including a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze[Microblaze soft CPU] require *Vitis* (this includes Vivado). These tools may be obtained from https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html[here].

* For Intel/Altera FPGAs, *Quartus Prime* is required - the free *Lite* edition is sufficient. This includes a free edition of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelSim[Questa] simulator. Versions since *21.1* are supported. Quartus may be obtained from https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html[here].

. The free open source <<doc/nvc.adoc#,NVC>> and <<doc/ghdl.adoc#,GHDL>> simulators are supported by most simulations. Note that you may need to pre-compile vendor libraries.

. Some builds require https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3].

. Projects including a 6502 or compatible CPU require the the *ca65* assembler and *ld65* linker from the https://cc65.github.io/[cc65] toolchain.

. https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] is now a supported make target. Run `make vscode` to build a directory workspace and open the editor. The build process also generates the required `config.v4p` file for the excellent http://www.vide-software.at/[VHDL for Professionals (V4P)] VS Code extension.

. https://vhdl-style-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[VHDL Style Guide] is supported with a custom configuration file. To fix all source files, run `make` in the `src/` directory.
