= The Tyto Project (Version 2)

The Tyto Project is a collection of open source FPGA designs and IP for retro computing and embedded systems, with an emphasis on VHDL and support for both AMD/Xilinx and Intel/Altera targets.

This repository is incomplete. Work to port all the designs and IP from the https://github.com/amb5l/tyto_project[previous version] is ongoing.

A simpler directory structure is used:

* `src` contains source code for designs as well as common IP.

* `build` contains makefiles for designs on supported targets. The subdirectory name consists of the design name followed by the target name. For simulation only cases, the target name indicates the simulator: `xsim` for Xilinx Vivado, `ghdl` for http://ghdl.free.fr/[GHDL] and `sim` for Questa, ModelSim etc.

* `doc` contains documentation.

* `submodules` contains git submodules.

NOTE: ALL designs have submodule dependencies. Please remember to initialise submodules when cloning this repo!

|Name|Supported Boards|Description

|<<./doc/designs/ddr3_test/ddr3_test.adoc#,ddr3_test >> 
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong
|A simple DDR3 SDRAM tester based on https://github.com/jorisvr/vhdl_prng[Joris van Rantwijk's Pseudo Random Number Generator]. Hacks the generated HDL to generate the 200MHz IODELAYCTRL reference clock in the DDR3 IP core MMCM.

|<<./doc/designs/hdmi_tpg/hdmi_tpg.adoc#,hdmi_tpg>>
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong
|HDMI test pattern generator. Displays a test pattern on an HDMI monitor at various SD and HD TV resolutions. Includes test audio output.

|<<./doc/designs/mb_cb/mb_cb.adoc#,mb_cb>>
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong
|A MicroBlaze CPU with a character buffer display, supporting 480i60 and 576i50 resolutions.

|<<./doc/designs/mb_cb_ps2/mb_cb_ps2.adoc#,mb_cb_ps2>>
|Digilent Nexys Video
|The <<./doc/designs/mb_cb/mb_cb.adoc#,mb_cb>> design with an added PS/2 keyboard interface.

|<<./doc/designs/mb_fb/mb_fb.adoc#,mb_fb>>
|Digilent Nexys Video, QMTech Wukong
|A MicroBlaze CPU with a 24 bpp high resolution graphics frame buffer held in DDR3 SDRAM, with simple demo application based on link:https://github.com/tuupola/hagl[Mike Tuupola's hagl graphics library].

== Build and Simulation Tools

1. https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU make] is required, along with https://git-scm.com/[git] and assorted utilities that are usually present on Linux systems. <<doc/msys2.adoc#,MSYS2>> is a quick and easy way to get GNU tools (as well as the http://ghdl.free.fr/[GHDL] simulator) running on Windows.

2. The build process depends on vendor tools, and produces projects that can be opened and worked on in the vendor IDE:

* For AMD/Xilinx FPGAs, *Vivado* is required - the free *Standard Edition* is sufficient. Versions *2022.1* and *2021.2* are supported. Note that designs including a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze[Microblaze soft CPU] also require *Vitis*. These tools may be obtained from https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html[here].

* For Intel/Altera FPGAs, *Quartus Prime* is required - the free *Lite* edition is sufficient. Version *21.1* is supported. This may be obtained from https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html[here].

3. Some builds include https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3] scripts.

4. Projects including a 6502 or compatible CPU require the the *ca65* assembler and *ld65* linker from the https://cc65.github.io/[cc65] toolchain.
